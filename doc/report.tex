\section{Introduction}
The open RISC-V instruction set architecture has gained significant popularity both in academia and in industry. Within the \emph{Advanced Computer Architecture} course at TU Wien, a minimalistic superscalar RISC-V processor called \emph{A Little Riscy} has been designed. It implements the RISC-V RV32I instruction set and allows parallel execution of ALU and load/store instructions.

\end{figure}

\section{Implementation}

The implemented processor follows the architecture depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:basic_arch}. Thus, it features a Harvard architecture with a four stage pipeline (Fetch, Dispatch, Execute, Write Back) with an ALU and a load/store unit in parallel in the execution stage. In order to utilise the parallel execution units, two instructions per cycle are fetched, enqueued, dequeued and dispatched respectively. The whole design was implemented using the \emph{Chisel} hardware description language.

%# TODO move?
As the evaluation of the processor was conducted with rather simple single-threaded programs (cf. Section~\ref{sec:eval}), the following instructions were not implemented and thus interpreted as NOP: FENCE, ECALL, EBREAK. Otherwise, \emph{A Little Riscy} is except for some memory limitations (cf. Section~\ref{sec:memory}) compliant with the RV32I instruction set.


\subsection{Fetch Unit}
The fetch unit loads two instructions per cycle from the instruction memory and places them into the instruction queue. Additionally, it administrates the PC. In case the queue is full, the whole fetching process is stalled.

Furthermore, it implements all control flow transfer instructions. This implies the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item As there is no ALU in a previous pipeline stage, additional hardware is required for address calculations.
	\item To ensure the correct register values are present while calculating addresses, the fetch unit has to wait for all previous instructions to take effect before the calculation. This implies that no instructions can be queued until the whole pipeline is idle.
\end{itemize}

The latter can in principle be mitigated using branch prediction an speculative execution techniques, however this was outside the scope of this project.

\subsection{Instruction Queue}
The instruction queue is a simple register based FIFO (cf. the \verb|RegFifo| in \cite{schoeberl}) with a width of $96$~bits ($2\times32$~bits instruction, $32$~bits PC). This brings the limitation that only the two instructions being enqueued together can be dequeued at the same time. In case of structural hazards, this leads to a serialised processing.
